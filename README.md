# CONSOLE FILE MANAGER
This is a simple file console manager that I made because I was bored lol

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** The executable `dirs` has been compiled on a Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS machine, so it may not work for you. To get the appropriate file, compile the file `dirs.c` on your machine with a C compiler of your choice.

# This is still work in progress, contributions will be highly appreciated!
